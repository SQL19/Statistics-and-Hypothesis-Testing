    "### Overview\n",
    "The chi-squared (χ²) test is a statistical method used to determine whether there is a significant association between categorical variables. It is a non-parametric test that compares the observed frequencies in each category with the frequencies expected if there were no association (i.e., the variables are independent). The test measures how well the observed data fits with the expected distribution based on a specific hypothesis."

    "- Purpose: It assesses whether an observed frequency distribution matches an expected distribution. Essentially, it tests if a single categorical variable fits a specific distribution.\n",

    "- Example: Checking if a six-sided die is fair by comparing the observed frequency of each outcome (1 to 6) with the expected frequency if the die were fair."
